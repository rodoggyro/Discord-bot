# Welcome to Node 16!

This template provides an easy way to use NodeJS v16 on Replit! As of writing, NodeJS repls have Node v12, which is several years out of date.

## Differences from Node Repls
If you're used to the Node repl environment, you'll notice a few changes:
- No packages menu
- No unit testing menu
- No language console

### Solving these problems
1. #### No Packages Menu
The packages menu helps to make the process of installing packages simpler, but this is not available. To install a package, run the following in the shell:
`npm install --save PACKAGE_NAME`
Just replace `PACKAGE_NAME` with the name of the package you're trying to install.

2. #### No Unit Testing Menu
Node repls have a unit testing menu, which helps to make sure that code works correctly, due to limitations in replit, this is not possible to be in this type of repl, instead, try using a library such as [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) or [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

3. #### No Language console
If you want to have a direct JavaScript console, run `node` in the shell.
